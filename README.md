# Churn-Analytics---Employee-Churn

Employee Churn as applied to an organization’s workforce, is a measurement of the reduction of staff during a set period of time. Most companies measure it annually. It encompasses all reasons for separation including resignation, termination or retirement. 

A high churn rate impacts an organization in several ways. First, it can cripple a company financially because costs for recruiting, hiring, and training are significant. The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) places the cost to replace a worker at six to nine months of the annual salary for the position. At that rate, it could cost from $17,500 to $26,250 to replace an employee earning a $35,000 yearly salary. Employers who reduce their churn rate can save money on hiring and related costs which can, in turn, increase their profit margin.

Secondly, a high churn rate limits a company because it results in a staff that is perennially composed of less-experienced employees. This puts a burden on the employees with more skills and experience. They may grow to resent shouldering the bulk of the workload. If it leads to experienced employees quitting, it can trigger a downward spiral that is hard to reverse.

Thirdly, a high churn rate damages the company’s reputation which, in turn, can dissuade customers, investors and make it harder to attract new employees.

In this project, I work with classification models like Logistic Regression Classifier, Ramdon Forest classifier, Desion tree classifier, SVG and KNN to help the organization in improving the churn rate and come up with strategies to improve the working experience of its employees.
